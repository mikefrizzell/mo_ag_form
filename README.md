# About
Python script to flood the Missouri AG's transgender center form with fake reports. It creates a fake name, fake address, fake email, and a random comment. 

# About the comments
I initially wrote what I thought were real-looking comments, but after some criticism I realize that was going a little too far. The comments are just generic complaints with some nonsense sprinkled in.

# Usage
Download the folder. Navigate to the folder in the terminal. Run fill_form.py.

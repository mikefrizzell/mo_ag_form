# About
Python script to flood the Missouri AG's transgender center form with fake reports. It creates a fake name, fake address, fake email, and a random comment. 

# Trigger warning
I wrote some pretty vile stuff in the comments.txt file to make the comments seem real. I'm sorry in advance, it's all for a good cause.

# Usage
Download the folder. Navigate to the folder in the terminal. Run fill_form.py.

# This script no longer works
As of 4/19/23 the website has added CAPTCHA, so this script won't work. I suppose someone could use 2captcha or another service to solve the captcha. Or, you could use Selenium to fill out the form and then bring the captcha up for you to solve. Either of those might work, but I'm not interested in pursuing it any further.

Keep submitting fake reports manually and waste their time. It's not much but it's honest work.

# About
Python script to flood the Missouri AG's transgender center form with fake reports. It creates a fake name, fake address, fake email, and a random comment. 

# About the comments
I initially wrote what I thought were real-looking comments, but after some criticism I realize that was going a little too far. The comments are just generic complaints with some nonsense sprinkled in.

# Usage
* Download the folder
* Navigate to the folder in the terminal
* Run fill_form.py

        python fill_form.py

# Warning
This script comes with no guarantees. You may get into trouble for using it. If you run it too many times, they'll probably just block your IP address, so use it sparingly. The point is to get a lot of people using it, not a few using it like a DOS attack.

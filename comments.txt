I was dissatisfied with the quality of care I received from Barton's gender clinic.
I felt rushed and not listened to by the doctors.
They did not explain the treatment options or risks thoroughly.
They rushed me to make a decision without giving time to think things through.
St. Mary's did not respect my privacy or confidentiality during my visit.
I received biased information that didn't consider all sides.
I was not given adequate information about the side effects or potential complications of the treatment recommended by Missouri Transgender Center.
They spoke to my child without my consent.
St. Louis gender clinic is treating minors and violating the law.
The doctor did not follow proper protocols or procedures during my visit.
They are mutilating children.
Liberal bullshit ruining this country.
They promote an idealogy the runs counter to the Judeo-Christian values this country was built on.
